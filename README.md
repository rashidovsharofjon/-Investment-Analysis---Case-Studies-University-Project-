# Investment-Analysis Case-Studies (University Project)

This repository contains my university project on Investment Analysis, where I applied core capital budgeting and financial modeling techniques to real-world inspired case studies.  
The project demonstrates advanced skills in **NPV, IRR, Payback, ROI, PI, inflation adjustment, sensitivity analysis, and risk-based project comparison** — all modeled in Excel.  

## Project Overview  

The project consists of four major tasks, each highlighting a different aspect of investment decision-making:  

1. **Capital Budgeting with Loan Financing**
   - Evaluated a 6-year project with mixed financing (equity + debt).  
   - Applied NPV, IRR, Payback Period, Discounted Payback, ROI, and PI.  
   - **Result:** Highly profitable (NPV ≈ 22.4M, IRR ≈ 84%), rapid payback in ~1 year 129 days.  

3. **Investment Analysis under Inflation**  
   - Incorporated inflation into project evaluation.  
   - Compared real vs nominal rates and profitability impacts.  
   - **Result:** Inflation significantly reduced profitability, showing its crucial role in long-term investment analysis.  

4. **Sensitivity Analysis – Fixed vs Variable Costs**  
   - Case study on a $200,000 production line investment (5 years).  
   - Tested impact of +20% fixed costs vs +20% variable costs on NPV.  
   - **Result:** Variable costs had a stronger negative impact on profitability.  

5. **Risk-Based Comparison of Two Projects**  
   - Compared two mutually exclusive projects using probabilistic NPV (pessimistic, realistic, optimistic scenarios).  
   - **Result:**  
     - Project A → safer, more stable returns.  
     - Project B → higher upside potential but riskier.  

## Skills  

- Capital Budgeting: NPV, IRR, PI, ROI, Payback Period  
- Sensitivity & Risk Analysis  
- Inflation Adjustment: Real vs Nominal discount rates  
- Excel Financial Modeling  
- Decision-Making under Uncertainty
